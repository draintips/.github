Deep Recursive AI Neural TIPS is for an AI/ML learning exercise that is about AI/ML systems and how they adapt as they learn about their game, like [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) in game playing ... except the metaphor for thinking about problems in this exercise is about the chore of clearing a clogged drain and playing against whatever is adapting and trying to re-clog that drain or possibly using a solution that leads to the destruction of pipes and makes the initial situation 100X worse than just a drain that is slow to drain.  In other words, DRAIN.tips is also safey and the reason why the [the theory of unintendend consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences) has to be a consideration. 

In impossibly tough problems, we can get too fixated on solving the problem, leading to a perverse result in which there is a perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended, in which the brilliant solution actually cause a different problem making the situation far worse. Clogged drains are a simple, yet intellectual demanding game that is even, seemingly easier and definitely older than chess or Go ... but as long as people depend on just flushing problems down drains, drains will keep getting clogged and even worse problems may arise. There are only so many cost-effective moves that the clogger can make, but yet this game of adaptively adjustment and inventive problem solving for problems one cannot first see directly will probably be with us for a very long time.
