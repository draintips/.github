Clogged drains are a simple, yet intellectual demanding game that is even older than chess or Go. There are only so many moves that the clogger can make, but yet this game will probably be with us for a very long time.

This organization is for an AI/ML exercise like [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo] in game playing, except this exercise is about the game of clearing a clogged drain and playing against the clogger. This exercise will include advanced learning for the developing fresh new ideas to ultimately unclog a clogged drain and possibly this game might lead to intelligent strategiess for keeping a drain free of clogs.
